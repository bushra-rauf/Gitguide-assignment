        <p>Git Commands We Used to Build This Project throughout the development process, our team used several Git commands to collaborate and manage the codebase efficiently. Here are some of the essential commands we relied on:</p>
        <h4>git clone </h4>
        <p> Firstly we clone the project repository from Github to local machine </p>
        <h4>git branch</h4>
        <p>Create a new branch for feature development or bug fixes.</p>
        <h4>git checkout </h4>
        <p> Switch between branches to manage different features or stages of the project. </p>
        <h4>git merge</h4>
        <p> Merge feature branches back into the main branch once they have been reviewed and approved.</p>
        <h4>git pull origin</h4>
        <p> Pull the latest changes from a specific branch of the remote repository to ensure you are workingwith the most up-to-date code.</p>
        <h4>git add . </h4>
        <p>Stage all the changes made to the files, preparing them for commit.</p>
        <h4>git commit -m "commit message"</h4>
        <p>Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message that explains what was updated.</p>
        <h4>git push origin [branch-name]</h4>
