               <h3>The Steps involved in creating a project on GitHub: </h3>

                <ul>
                    Sign Up/In: Create an account or sign in if you already have one.

                    Create a New Repository:

                    Click on the + sign in the upper-right corner and select New repository.

                    Name your repository, add a description, and decide if it should be public or private.

                    Initialize the repository with a README if you like.

                    Clone the Repository:

                    If you are working locally, clone the repo using git clone <repository-url>.

                    Add Files: Add your project files to the repository folder.

                    Commit Changes:

                    Stage your changes with git add ..

                    Commit them with git commit -m "Initial commit".

                    Push Changes:

                    Push the changes to GitHub using git push origin main (or whatever your branch name is).

                    Collaborate: Share the repository link with others to collaborate.

                    Use branches and pull requests to manage changes and reviews.

                    And there you have it! Your project is live on GitHub and ready for the world. 


                <h3>Details the relevant git commands relevant to creating a project locally</h3> 

                <h4> Here's a cheat sheet for setting up a project locally using Git: </h4> 

                <h4> Initialize a Repository: </h4>
                <ol>  
                    bash: git init
                    Sets up a new Git repository.
                    
                    Add Files: 
                    bash: git add .

                    Commit Changes:
                    bash: git commit -m "Initial commit"
                    Commits your staged files with a message.

                    Create a Remote Repository on GitHub (via GitHub website):

                    Create a new repository and get the repository URL.

                    Link Local Repository to GitHub:
                    bash: git remote add origin <repository-url>

                    Connects your local repository to the GitHub repository.

                    bush Changes to GitHub:
                    bash :git push -u origin master

                    Pushes your committed changes to the master branch on GitHub. Replace master with main if necessary.
                    
                    
                    Check Repository Status:
                    bash: git status
                    Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area.

                    See Commit History:
                    bash: git log
                    Displays the commit history for the repository.
                </ol>    
                
                <h3>Details the git commands to link the local and remote repos</h3>
                <h4>Add Remote Repository:</h4>
                <h4>Note: When you make new repository on the same at the bottom you can copy paste one by one and enter on bash  </h4> 
                 <ol>  
                    git remote add origin https://github.com/bushra-rauf/ada.git
                    git branch -m main
                    git push -u origin main
                </ol>

                <h3>Detail how other people can contribute to the project </h3>

                    The contribution begin with the Html code writing and styling the website.

                    To contribute to a project in GitHub, other people can follow these steps:

                    1, The Repository: They can create their own copy of the project by forking the repository. This allows them to make changes without affecting the original project. </h3>
                    
                    2. Clone the Repository: After forking, they can clone their forked repository to their local machine using Git. This allows them to work on the project offline.
                    
                    3. Create a Branch: It's a good practice to create a new branch for their changes. This keeps the main branch clean and allows for easier collaboration.
                    
                    4. Make Changes: They can then make their desired changes or additions to the project in their branch.
                    
                    5. Commit Changes: Once they are satisfied with their changes, they should commit them with a clear and descriptive message explaining what they did.
                    
                    6. Push Changes: After committing, they can push their changes back to their forked repository on GitHub.
                    
                    7. Open a Pull Request: Finally, they can open a pull request from their branch in the forked repository to the original repository. This is where they can discuss their changes with the project maintainers and get feedback.
                    
                    8. Engage in Discussion: They should be open to feedback and ready to make further changes if necessary. Collaboration is key!
                    
                    By following these steps, anyone can contribute to a project on GitHub and help improve it! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
