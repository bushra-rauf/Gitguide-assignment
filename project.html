               <h3>The Steps involved in creating a project on GitHub: </h3>

                <ul>
                    Sign Up/In: Create an account or sign in if you already have one.

                    Create a New Repository:

                    Click on the + sign in the upper-right corner and select New repository.

                    Name your repository, add a description, and decide if it should be public or private.

                    Initialize the repository with a README if you like.

                    Clone the Repository:

                    If you are working locally, clone the repo using git clone <repository-url>.

                    Add Files: Add your project files to the repository folder.

                    Commit Changes:

                    Stage your changes with git add ..

                    Commit them with git commit -m "Initial commit".

                    Push Changes:

                    Push the changes to GitHub using git push origin main (or whatever your branch name is).

                    Collaborate: Share the repository link with others to collaborate.

                    Use branches and pull requests to manage changes and reviews.

                    And there you have it! Your project is live on GitHub and ready for the world. 


                <h3>Details the relevant git commands relevant to creating a project locally</h3> 

                <h4> Here's a cheat sheet for setting up a project locally using Git: </h4> 

                <h4> Initialize a Repository: </h4>
                <ol>  
                    bash: git init
                    Sets up a new Git repository.
                    
                    Add Files: 
                    bash: git add .

                    Commit Changes:
                    bash: git commit -m "Initial commit"
                    Commits your staged files with a message.

                    Create a Remote Repository on GitHub (via GitHub website):

                    Create a new repository and get the repository URL.

                    Link Local Repository to GitHub:
                    bash: git remote add origin <repository-url>

                    Connects your local repository to the GitHub repository.

                    bush Changes to GitHub:
                    bash :git push -u origin master

                    Pushes your committed changes to the master branch on GitHub. Replace master with main if necessary.
                    
                    
                    Check Repository Status:
                    bash: git status
                    Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area.

                    See Commit History:
                    bash: git log
                    Displays the commit history for the repository.
                </ol>
